<h1> AsciiArt </h1>
<h2> First steps into learning Java.</h2>

<p1> About a week ago I made an effort to start teaching myself Java. My primary programming language to-date is Python, but I've heard that learning a statically typed language makes one a better programmer in general. I enjoy the challenge of learning something new and even though I didn't have any reason to use Java for this project, I thought it'd be worth trying out.  </p1>

<p1> The first step in learning any language is of course to write "Hello world!". Even doing something this basic is worth celebrating for anyone starting out. I found Java to be particularly daunting, as doing anything in the language involves a degree of complexity that is pleasantly absent from Python. But with any degree of persistence, this initial frustration fades and `public static void main(String[] args)` begins to make some sense. After successfully compiling my first code in Java, I wanted to dive into a slightly more ambitious project. </p1>

<h2> Why this project? </h2>

<p1> Many years ago, I took guitar lessons in a small room not much larger than a closet. On one wall was a printed out portrait created from text art. The concept stuck with me and part of me has wanted to do my own self-portait using a similar concept since then. Of course, there a number of different ways to use Ascii characters to create art. </p1>
